**Prompt for Claude:**

**Your Role:** You are an expert resume writer and career coach specializing in optimizing resumes for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

**Objective:** Rewrite my work experience section for my previous role as a `[Your Previous Role Title]` to make it highly ATS-compliant for a new job I am targeting. Your rewrite should seamlessly incorporate specific keywords, ensure every bullet point includes a quantifiable achievement, and consider my specific ideas for modifications.

**Input Information:**

1.  **My Previous Role:**
    `[Your Previous Role Title]`

2.  **My Original Work Experience (for the role above):**
    ```
    [Paste your original work experience bullet points here. Use bullet points or numbered lists.]
    ```

3.  **Target Job Information:**
    *(Please provide details about the new job you're applying for here. You can paste the job title, key responsibilities from the job description, or a general description of the type of role. This context is crucial for tailoring.)*
    `[Describe the target job or paste key requirements/responsibilities here]`

4.  **ATS-Friendly Keywords to Incorporate:**
    {numbered_skills_str}

5.  **My Ideas for Specific Modifications/Bullet Points:**
    *(These are the specific points you thought made sense)*
    ```
    [List your specific ideas for rewritten bullet points or concepts you want emphasized, e.g., "Focus on cost savings achieved through process optimization," "Highlight experience managing cross-functional teams," "Quantify client retention rate improvement."]
    ```

**Instructions for Claude:**

1.  **Analyze:** Review my original work experience, the target job information, the required keywords, and my specific ideas.
2.  **Rewrite for ATS:** Rephrase each bullet point using action verbs and language that is easily parsed by ATS software.
3.  **Integrate Keywords:** Naturally weave the provided `[List of Keywords]` into the rewritten bullet points where relevant. Avoid keyword stuffing; ensure they fit contextually.
4.  **Quantify Everything:** For *every* bullet point, add a specific, measurable result or quantifier. Use numbers, percentages, dollar amounts, timeframes, or scales (e.g., "managed a team of 5," "improved efficiency by 15%," "handled budgets up to $500k," "reduced project delivery time by 2 weeks," "increased customer satisfaction scores by 10 points"). If exact numbers aren't available from my original text, suggest realistic, plausible quantifiers based on the described task â€“ clearly indicate these are suggestions if necessary (e.g., "potentially saving X hours/week" or "resulting in an estimated Y% increase").
5.  **Incorporate My Ideas:** Make sure to include or adapt the specific modifications and bullet point ideas I provided in section 5.
6.  **Format:** Present the final output as a list of bullet points suitable for a resume work experience section.
7.  **Focus:** Ensure the rewritten experience highlights skills and achievements most relevant to the `[Target Job Information]` provided.

**Output:**

Please provide the rewritten, ATS-optimized, and quantified work experience bullet points for my role as `[Your Previous Role Title]`.""")
